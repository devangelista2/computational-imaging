    "# Diffusion Models for Image Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously introduced, in this final chapter we will discuss more in details the working mechanism of Diffusion Models, the state-of-the-art for image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Diffusion Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion models are a class of generative models that produce data samples by **iteratively denoising a Gaussian noise vector**. Unlike GANs or VAEs, they are **likelihood-based models** that combine principles from **non-equilibrium thermodynamics** and **probabilistic modeling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to define a **Markov chain** that slowly destroys the structure of data by adding Gaussian noise over several steps, and then train a neural network to **reverse this noising process**, recovering the original data.\n",
    "\n",

    "### The Forward Process: Gradual Noising\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x_0 \\sim p_{\\text{data}}(x)$ be a sample from the real data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a sequence of latent variables $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_T$ where noise is added at each step according to a predefined variance schedule $ \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_T$. The forward (noising) process is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "q(x_t \\mid x_{t-1}) = \\mathcal{N}(x_t; \\sqrt{1 - \\beta_t} \\, x_{t-1}, \\beta_t I)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **Markov process** that gradually transforms the data into pure noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also write the marginal distribution of $x_t$ directly given $x_0$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "q(x_t \\mid x_0) = \\mathcal{N}(x_t; \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} x_0, (1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t) I)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha_t = 1 - \\beta_t, \\quad \\bar{\\alpha}_t = \\prod_{s=1}^t \\alpha_s\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, as $t \\to T$, $x_t$ becomes close to an isotropic Gaussian $\\mathcal{N}(0, I)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Reverse Process: Learning to Denoise\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to learn the **reverse-time process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_\\theta(x_{t-1} \\mid x_t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the forward process, this is **not known analytically**. We approximate it using a neural network parameterized by $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a Gaussian form for the reverse conditional:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_\\theta(x_{t-1} \\mid x_t) = \\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t), \\Sigma_\\theta(x_t, t))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Most models fix $\\Sigma_\\theta$ and train the network to predict only the mean (or alternatively the noise that was added, as we'll see next).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Denoising Score Matching (Simplified View)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than modeling the full posterior $p_\\theta(x_{t-1} \\mid x_t)$, the training objective is simplified by using **denoising score matching**. The network learns to **predict the noise** $\\epsilon$ added at each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_t = \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\, \\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network $\\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t)$ is trained to minimize the expected squared error:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{simple}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{x_0, \\epsilon, t} \\left[ \\left\\| \\epsilon - \\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t) \\right\\|^2 \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation greatly simplifies training and leads to excellent sample quality.\n",

    "### Summary of Diffusion Model Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forward process**: adds small amounts of Gaussian noise step-by-step to data\n",
    "- **Reverse process**: learned by a neural network to denoise\n",
    "- **Final sample generation**: starts from pure Gaussian noise and applies the learned denoising steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework allows for **stable training**, unlike GANs, and for **high-quality image synthesis**, often outperforming VAEs and GANs in perceptual quality."

    "## Training Diffusion Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have defined the forward noising process and the reverse denoising model, the training phase consists in teaching the neural network to **predict the noise** that was added to a clean image.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a **time-dependent neural network** $\\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t)$ that receives as input a noisy image $x_t$ and a timestep $t$, and tries to estimate the noise $\\epsilon$ used to corrupt the original clean image $x_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap: Sampling from the Forward Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we can sample a noisy image $x_t$ directly given the clean image $x_0$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_t = \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\, x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\, \\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a way to **synthetically generate training data pairs** \\((x_t, \\epsilon)\\) from a dataset of real images $x_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained by minimizing the **mean squared error** between the predicted noise and the actual sampled noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{simple}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{x_0, \\epsilon, t} \\left[ \\left\\| \\epsilon - \\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t) \\right\\|^2 \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has the following advantages:\n",
    "- It avoids explicitly computing the reverse conditional distribution.\n",
    "- It is **simple to implement**.\n",
    "- It works well in practice.\n",
