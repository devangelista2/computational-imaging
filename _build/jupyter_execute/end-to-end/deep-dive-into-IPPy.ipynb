    "# Deep dive into `IPPy`\n",
    "\n",
    "`IPPy` is a simple library, developed by me specifically for this course (and to support me during my experiments for papers). It includes multiple modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `nn`: contains functions to easy define complex neural network models, such as UNet, ViT, and others, with a flexible design.\n",
    "- `solvers`: implements a few optimization algorithms already discussed in the first module of this course, such as the `ChambollePock` algorithm for TV minimization, the `SGP` algorithm for smoothed-TV regularization, and others.\n",
    "- `operators`: implements multiple operators (we will check some of them below) specifically designed to work well with pytorch tensors. Not only they are developed so that they can efficiently work with batched, multidimensional data, but they also implement gradient tracking, useful to backpropagate the gradient back from the output to the input of the inverse process. This is useful in applications such as Algorithm Unrolling or Deep Generative Prior (DGP).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for `IPPy` can be simply dowloaded from my Github page at: [https://github.com/devangelista2/IPPy](https://github.com/devangelista2/IPPy).\n",

    "## Introduction and requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "IPPy is built upon a few commonly used libraries for tensor manipulation, linear algebra, Computed Tomography, neural networks and visualization. Here is a list of the libraries you need to install to make IPPy run smoothly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `numpy`\n",
    "- `numba`\n",
    "- `astra-toolbox`\n",
    "- `scikit-image`\n",
    "- `PIL`\n",
    "- `matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it is **required** to have access to a cuda GPU, both for training neural network models and for fast Computed Tomography simulations. In particular, some `astra-toolbox` operators won't work if CUDA is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "In case one has no access to a `cuda` GPU, it can be also installed the `cpu` version of `astra-toolbox` (a few geometries won't work in this setup, but it is ok for the topic of this course).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically all the required libraries can be simply install with the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install <PACKAGE_NAME>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install <PACKAGE_NAME>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The only exception is `astra-toolbox`, whose installation instruction can be found in its official documentation website, at: [https://astra-toolbox.com](https://astra-toolbox.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "As already remarked, all the `IPPy` functions are thought to work with Pytorch tensors. In particular, with what is called a **standardized pytorch tensor**, that is a tensor with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Its shape is `(N, c, n_x, n_y)`, where `c` is either equal to 1 or 3.\n",
    "- It is normalized so that its maximum is 1 and its minimum is 0.\n",
    "- Its `ndtype` is `float32`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While most of the functions still works if some of these properties are not satisfied, the obtained results could be artificious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that, we can now move to the core of the `IPPy` package: the `operators` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `operators` module\n",
    "\n",
    "An `IPPy` operator is a Python class that simulates the application of a corruption matrix $K$ to an input tensor $x$. The basic `Operator` class is defined as follows:"
