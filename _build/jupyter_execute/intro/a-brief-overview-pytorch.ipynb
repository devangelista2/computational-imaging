    "# A brief overview of PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will briefly introduce PyTorch: arguably the most used library for developing Neural Network models in Python. In particular, we will focus on few key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tensors:** Tensors are the building block of any pytorch model. Since we will largely use them, we need to at least learn their main properties and functionalities;\n",
    "- **Data:** Loading data in memory is a fundamental step in developing Neural Network-based models, and it requires special attention when the number of datapoints is large;\n",
    "- **Model Design:** A good model requires carefully optimizing its architecture (i.e. number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation function, ...). In this chapter we will learn how to deploy a simple MLP network, and we will come back to architecture design later in the course;\n",
    "- **Training:** Training a model (i.e. optimizing its parameters to achieve the task described by the dataset) requires setting up a few basic components. In this chapter, we will learn how to train a neural network model on a fairly simple dataset, with the default choices of each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "While we will try to cover all the basics of Neural Network in this course, what described in the following is far from being a complete introduction to the topic. Please refer to the official [pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org) or to any tutorial on Youtube for a more complete introduction.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is PyTorch?\n",
    "PyTorch is an **open-source deep learning framework** developed by Facebookâ€™s AI Research Lab (FAIR). It provides **tensor computation**, **automatic differentiation**, and **deep learning model building** capabilities with a user-friendly and Pythonic interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is widely used in both research and industry due to its **flexibility**, **ease of debugging**, and **strong community support**. It enables researchers and developers to quickly prototype and train neural networks using GPUs for acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of PyTorch\n",
    "- **Dynamic Computational Graphs**: Unlike TensorFlow 1.x, which relied on static graphs, PyTorch dynamically builds computational graphs, making it easier to debug and modify models.\n",
    "- **Automatic Differentiation (Autograd)**: PyTorch automatically computes gradients, making it seamless to implement **backpropagation** for neural networks (a topic which will be deeper explained later).\n",
    "- **GPU Acceleration**: PyTorch seamlessly integrates with CUDA and MPS (on Apple Silicon CPUs) for **fast GPU computing**.\n",
    "- **Strong Ecosystem**: Includes tools like `torchvision` for images, `torchtext` for NLP, and `torchaudio` for speech processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch vs. TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch and TensorFlow are the two most popular deep learning frameworks. Hereâ€™s a **comparison of their strengths and weaknesses**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature           | PyTorch | TensorFlow |\n",
    "|------------------|---------|------------|\n",
    "| **Ease of Use** | Intuitive, Pythonic | More complex, requires more boilerplate |\n",
    "| **Dynamic Graphs** | âœ… Yes | ðŸš« No (TF 1.x), âœ… Yes (TF 2.x) |\n",
    "| **Debugging** | Easier (native Python debugging tools) | More difficult (static graphs in TF 1.x) |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Excellent for research and fast prototyping | Optimized for large-scale deployment |\n",
    "| **Ecosystem** | Torchvision, TorchText, TorchAudio | TensorFlow Hub, TF-Agents (RL), TensorFlow.js |\n",
    "| **Industry Adoption** | Preferred in research | Preferred in large-scale industry applications |\n",
    "| **Community Support** | Strong in academia and research | Larger enterprise-level adoption |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which One Should You Choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "During your master degree, you will get in touch with both the frameworks described above. In particular, the course *Deep Learning* from professor Andrea Asperti will teach you Tensorflow, while we will use Pytorch in this course. However, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choose PyTorch if**:\n",
    "  - You prioritize **ease of use** and fast prototyping.\n",
    "  - You work in **research** or academia.\n",
    "  - You need **dynamic graphs** for flexible model structures.\n",
    "- **Choose TensorFlow if**:\n",
    "  - You want **better production-ready tools** for deployment.\n",
    "  - You are working in **enterprise applications** with large-scale models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch provides an easy installation process. You can install it using `pip` (for Python users) or `conda` (for Anaconda users). It is sufficient to copy and paste the command from the official website: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) by selecting your system preferences from the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "I recommend to always use `pip` to install pytorch as it usually causes less issues.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## DataLoading\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning, we often work with *large datasets* that cannot fit into memory all at once. `torch` provides efficient tools to handle data loading through the `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytorchâ€™s `torch.utils.data.Dataset` is an abstract class that must be subclassed to define custom datasets. A `Dataset` object should implement three methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__`: Initializes the dataset (e.g., loads file paths, applies transformations).\n",
    "- `__len__`: Returns the total number of samples in the dataset.\n",
    "- `__getitem__`: Retrieves a single sample by index.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a Custom Dataset:** Mathematically, a dataset is a sequence of pairs $\\{ (x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)}, y^{(2)}), \\dots, (x^{(N)}, y^{(N)}) \\}$, where each $x^{(i)}$ is a $d$-dimensional vector, while $y^{(i)}$ is an $s$-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dataset in `torch`, we need to build a dataset class so that, when it is called on index `i`, it returns the couple $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ as a `tuple` of tensors with shape `(d, )` and `(s, )`, called **input** and **output** shape, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes (when the dimensionality of the data allows it), all the datapoints gets stacked together in two large tensors `X` and `Y`, which thus have shape `(N, d)` and `(N, s)`. Clearly, `X[i, :]` corresponds to the input tensor $x^{(i)}$, and `Y[i, :]` corresponds to the output tensor $y^{(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, as an example, the dataset $D = \\{ (x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)}, y^{(2)}), \\dots, (x^{(N)}, y^{(N)}) \\}$, such that $x^{(i)}$ are uniformly distributed datapoints in the range $[-2, 2]$, while $y^{(i)} = 2 x^{(i)} + 3$. In the following, we will avoid building `X` and `Y` explicitly, relying instead on definining a constructor that returns the pair $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ upon request."

On the other side, relying on single samples is usually too complex, as we would need more time to process the whole dataset.\n",

    "## Training a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably noticed that the model prediction is completely different from the real value of the target variable. This happens as the model has not been **trained** yet. As already remarked, training a model is the process of iteratively update its parameters $\\Theta$ so that it matches the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network model is usually trained by a variant of the **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** algorithm: the stochastic version of the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm. In particular, given an initial value for the model parameters $\\Theta_0$, a loss function $\\ell: \\mathbb{R}^s \\times \\mathbb{R}^s \\to \\mathbb{R}_+$, and a training dataset $D$, the SGD algorithms iteratively update the parameters based on the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample a batch $(x_b, y_b)$ from $D$.\n",
    "- Compute $g_k = \\nabla_{\\Theta} \\ell(f_{\\Theta_k}(x^{(i)}_b), y^{(i)}_b)$.\n",
    "- Update $\\Theta_{k+1} = \\Theta_k - \\nu g_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we already discussed how to create and sample a batch of data from $D$. The next step we need to learn is how to compute $g_k$, and here is where Pytorch becomes really useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "Pytorch tensors differs from numpy arrays mainly in that they keep track of each operations leading from a leaf tensor (i.e. a freshly created tensor) to the present tensor. This option (which is activated by default), can be modified by accessing the `requires_grad` property of the tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a leaf tensor is declared with `requires_grad = True`, each operation involving it gets memorized. This way, it is possible to automatically compute the gradient of any function with respect to the leaf tensor by **backpropagating** from the output to the input via the computational graph, using the **chain rule** to combine the derivative at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, we recall that if $g: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a function mapping a leaf tensor to an intermediate value $z = g(x)$, and $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a scalar function (such as a loss function), mapping $z$ to an output $y = f(z)$, then the gradient of $f(g(x))$ with respect of $x$ can be easily computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla_x f(g(x)) = J_g(x) \\nabla_z f(z).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is automatically performed in Pytorch by calling the `.backward()` method on any non-leaf tensor. The gradient with respect to $x$ can then be accessed by calling `x.grad`. For example:"
