    "# Introduction to Generative Models for Image Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models are a fundamental class of machine learning models that aim to **learn the distribution of data** in order to generate new, realistic samples. In the context of image processing, they allow us to synthesize novel images that are visually indistinguishable from real ones, by capturing the underlying data distribution of natural images.\n",
    "\n",
    "While discriminative models focus on modeling the conditional probability $p(y \\mid x)$ — that is, predicting a label $y$ given an input $x$ — **generative models try to model the full data distribution** $p(x)$, or more generally, the joint distribution $p(x, y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Generative Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to sample from a learned distribution has profound implications. Generative models can be used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data augmentation**: synthesize new examples to train better classifiers\n",
    "- **Image denoising**: estimate clean images from noisy ones\n",
    "- **Inpainting**: fill in missing parts of an image\n",
    "- **Super-resolution**: generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs\n",
    "- **Compression**: learn a compact latent representation of images\n",
    "- **Creative applications**: generate art, faces, textures, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we lay the foundation for understanding one of the most powerful classes of generative models today: **diffusion models**. But before diving into those, we start by exploring the general landscape of generative modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The General Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ denote an image (flattened to a vector), and let $p_{\\text{data}}(x)$ be the unknown data distribution. Our goal is to **learn a model** $p_\\theta(x)$, parameterized by $\\theta$, that approximates $p_{\\text{data}}(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard training objective is the **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta^* = \\arg\\max_\\theta \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{\\text{data}}} [\\log p_\\theta(x)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently, this corresponds to minimizing the **Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence** between the true data distribution and the model distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{KL}(p_{\\text{data}} \\, \\| \\, p_\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{\\text{data}}} \\left[ \\log \\frac{p_{\\text{data}}(x)}{p_\\theta(x)} \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower the KL divergence, the closer our model distribution is to the true one.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this framework depends on the ability to **evaluate or estimate** $\\log p_\\theta(x)$, which is not always feasible. This leads to different classes of models, depending on how they approach this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categories of Generative Models\n",
    "\n",
    "We can divide generative models into different categories based on their modeling approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Latent Variable Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent variable models assume that observed data $x$ is generated from some latent variable $z$, typically sampled from a simple distribution such as a Gaussian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "z \\sim p(z) \\quad \\text{(e.g., } \\mathcal{N}(0, I) \\text{)} \\\\\n",
    "x = G_\\theta(z)\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $G_\\theta$ is a neural network called the **generator**, mapping the latent space to the data space.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} /imgs/generative-model.png\n",
    ":width: 800px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Two popular examples of this family are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**\n",
    "- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now give a brief overview of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "A VAE introduces an encoder $q_\\phi(z \\mid x)$ and a decoder $p_\\theta(x \\mid z)$. The encoder maps an image to a distribution over the latent space, and the decoder maps latent samples back to images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training objective maximizes a lower bound on the log-likelihood, known as the **Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log p_\\theta(x) \\geq \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim q_\\phi(z \\mid x)} [\\log p_\\theta(x \\mid z)] - \\mathrm{KL}(q_\\phi(z \\mid x) \\, \\| \\, p(z))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term is a reconstruction term; the second is a regularization term that keeps $q_\\phi(z \\mid x)$ close to the prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Probabilistic interpretation\n",
    "- Well-defined log-likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Often produces blurry samples\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} /imgs/VAE.png\n",
    ":width: 800px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs are trained using an adversarial process between a **generator** $G_\\theta(z)$ and a **discriminator** $D_\\psi(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The generator maps latent variables $z \\sim p(z)$ to images\n",
    "- The discriminator tries to distinguish real images from generated ones\n",
    "\n",
    "The training objective is a minimax game:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_G \\max_D \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{\\text{data}}} [\\log D(x)] + \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)} [\\log(1 - D(G(z)))]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs are powerful but notoriously unstable during training. They do not model $p(x)$ explicitly and can suffer from **mode collapse**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} /imgs/GAN.png\n",
