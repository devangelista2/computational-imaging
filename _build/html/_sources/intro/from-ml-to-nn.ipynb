    "where each pair $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ consists of an input and its corresponding output. Think of the input data $x^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ as the available information and the output data $y^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^s$ as the quantity we want to predict. The input dimension, $d$, represents the number of input features, while the output dimension, $s$, corresponds to the number of variables we aim to predict. To simplify things, we usually represent these as vectors of size $d$ and $s$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Machine Learning is widely used to predict house prices based on property characteristics. Suppose we have a dataset where each house is described by features such as:  \n",

The first layer (depicted in blue in the figure) is called the *input layer*, and it contains a number of neurons equal to the input dimension $d$ of our data. Connected to the input layer is an intermediate layer called the *hidden layer*, whose number of neurons $H$ (called the *hidden dimension*) is a user-defined parameter. The name *hidden layer* comes from the fact that the values of its neurons are not accessible from the outside, as we usually only access its input and output. Each neuron in the hidden layer, $z_i$, is obtained by a linear transformation of the input data, i.e.\n",

One of the first and crucial evolutions was the adoption of multiple hidden layers. Indeed, note that we can simply iterate the process used to build the single hidden layer architecture above to define multiple hidden layers, each taking as input the output of the previous hidden layer and employing the classical linear transformation + non-linear activation, possibly improving the expressivity of the model.\n",
