    "# A brief overview of PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will briefly introduce PyTorch: arguably the most used library for developing Neural Network models in Python. In particular, we will focus on few key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tensors:** Tensors are the building block of any pytorch model. Since we will largely use them, we need to at least learn their main properties and functionalities;\n",
    "- **Data:** Loading data in memory is a fundamental step in developing Neural Network-based models, and it requires special attention when the number of datapoints is large;\n",
    "- **Model Design:** A good model requires carefully optimizing its architecture (i.e. number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation function, ...). In this chapter we will learn how to deploy a simple MLP network, and we will come back to architecture design later in the course;\n",
    "- **Training:** Training a model (i.e. optimizing its parameters to achieve the task described by the dataset) requires setting up a few basic components. In this chapter, we will learn how to train a neural network model on a fairly simple dataset, with the default choices of each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "While we will try to cover all the basics of Neural Network in this course, what described in the following is far from being a complete introduction to the topic. Please refer to the official [pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org) or to any tutorial on Youtube for a more complete introduction.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is PyTorch?\n",
    "PyTorch is an **open-source deep learning framework** developed by Facebookâ€™s AI Research Lab (FAIR). It provides **tensor computation**, **automatic differentiation**, and **deep learning model building** capabilities with a user-friendly and Pythonic interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is widely used in both research and industry due to its **flexibility**, **ease of debugging**, and **strong community support**. It enables researchers and developers to quickly prototype and train neural networks using GPUs for acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of PyTorch\n",
    "- **Dynamic Computational Graphs**: Unlike TensorFlow 1.x, which relied on static graphs, PyTorch dynamically builds computational graphs, making it easier to debug and modify models.\n",
    "- **Automatic Differentiation (Autograd)**: PyTorch automatically computes gradients, making it seamless to implement **backpropagation** for neural networks (a topic which will be deeper explained later).\n",
    "- **GPU Acceleration**: PyTorch seamlessly integrates with CUDA and MPS (on Apple Silicon CPUs) for **fast GPU computing**.\n",
    "- **Strong Ecosystem**: Includes tools like `torchvision` for images, `torchtext` for NLP, and `torchaudio` for speech processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch vs. TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch and TensorFlow are the two most popular deep learning frameworks. Hereâ€™s a **comparison of their strengths and weaknesses**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature           | PyTorch | TensorFlow |\n",
    "|------------------|---------|------------|\n",
    "| **Ease of Use** | Intuitive, Pythonic | More complex, requires more boilerplate |\n",
    "| **Dynamic Graphs** | âœ… Yes | ðŸš« No (TF 1.x), âœ… Yes (TF 2.x) |\n",
    "| **Debugging** | Easier (native Python debugging tools) | More difficult (static graphs in TF 1.x) |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Excellent for research and fast prototyping | Optimized for large-scale deployment |\n",
    "| **Ecosystem** | Torchvision, TorchText, TorchAudio | TensorFlow Hub, TF-Agents (RL), TensorFlow.js |\n",
    "| **Industry Adoption** | Preferred in research | Preferred in large-scale industry applications |\n",
    "| **Community Support** | Strong in academia and research | Larger enterprise-level adoption |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which One Should You Choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "During your master degree, you will get in touch with both the frameworks described above. In particular, the course *Deep Learning* from professor Andrea Asperti will teach you Tensorflow, while we will use Pytorch in this course. However, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choose PyTorch if**:\n",
    "  - You prioritize **ease of use** and fast prototyping.\n",
    "  - You work in **research** or academia.\n",
    "  - You need **dynamic graphs** for flexible model structures.\n",
    "- **Choose TensorFlow if**:\n",
    "  - You want **better production-ready tools** for deployment.\n",
    "  - You are working in **enterprise applications** with large-scale models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch provides an easy installation process. You can install it using `pip` (for Python users) or `conda` (for Anaconda users). It is sufficient to copy and paste the command from the official website: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) by selecting your system preferences from the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "I recommend to always use `pip` to install pytorch as it usually causes less issues.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, verify the installation by running the following command in Python:\n"

    "## DataLoading\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning, we often work with *large datasets* that cannot fit into memory all at once. `torch` provides efficient tools to handle data loading through the `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytorchâ€™s `torch.utils.data.Dataset` is an abstract class that must be subclassed to define custom datasets. A `Dataset` object should implement three methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__`: Initializes the dataset (e.g., loads file paths, applies transformations).\n",
    "- `__len__`: Returns the total number of samples in the dataset.\n",
    "- `__getitem__`: Retrieves a single sample by index.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a Custom Dataset:** Mathematically, a dataset is a sequence of pairs $\\{ (x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)}, y^{(2)}), \\dots, (x^{(N)}, y^{(N)}) \\}$, where each $x^{(i)}$ is a $d$-dimensional vector, while $y^{(i)}$ is an $s$-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dataset in `torch`, we need to build a dataset class so that, when it is called on index `i`, it returns the couple $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ as a `tuple` of tensors with shape `(d, )` and `(s, )`, called **input** and **output** shape, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes (when the dimensionality of the data allows it), all the datapoints gets stacked together in two large tensors `X` and `Y`, which thus have shape `(N, d)` and `(N, s)`. Clearly, `X[i, :]` corresponds to the input tensor $x^{(i)}$, and `Y[i, :]` corresponds to the output tensor $y^{(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, as an example, the dataset $D = \\{ (x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)}, y^{(2)}), \\dots, (x^{(N)}, y^{(N)}) \\}$, such that $x^{(i)}$ are uniformly distributed datapoints in the range $[-2, 2]$, while $y^{(i)} = 2 x^{(i)} + 3$. In the following, we will avoid building `X` and `Y` explicitly, relying instead on definining a constructor that returns the pair $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ upon request."

On the other side, relying on single samples is usually too complex, as we would need more time to process the whole dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "You probably noticed that the model prediction is completely different from the real value of the target variable. This happens as the model has not been **trained** yet. As already remarked, training a model is the process of iteratively update its parameters $\\Theta$ so that it matches the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network model is usually trained by a variant of the **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** algorithm: the stochastic version of the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm. In particular, given an initial value for the model parameters $\\Theta_0$, a loss function $\\ell: \\mathbb{R}^s \\times \\mathbb{R}^s \\to \\mathbb{R}_+$, and a training dataset $D$, the SGD algorithms iteratively update the parameters based on the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample a batch $(x_b, y_b)$ from $D$.\n",
    "- Compute $g_k = \\nabla_{\\Theta} \\ell(f_{\\Theta_k}(x^{(i)}_b), y^{(i)}_b)$.\n",
    "- Update $\\Theta_{k+1} = \\Theta_k - \\nu g_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we already discussed how to create and sample a batch of data from $D$. The next step we need to learn is how to compute $g_k$, and here is where Pytorch becomes really useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "Pytorch tensors differs from numpy arrays mainly in that they keep track of each operations leading from a leaf tensor (i.e. a freshly created tensor) to the present tensor. This option (which is activated by default), can be modified by accessing the `requires_grad` property of the tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a leaf tensor is declared with `requires_grad = True`, each operation involving it gets memorized. This way, it is possible to automatically compute the gradient of any function with respect to the leaf tensor by **backpropagating** from the output to the input via the computational graph, using the **chain rule** to combine the derivative at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, we recall that if $g: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a function mapping a leaf tensor to an intermediate value $z = g(x)$, and $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a scalar function (such as a loss function), mapping $z$ to an output $y = f(z)$, then the gradient of $f(g(x))$ with respect of $x$ can be easily computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla_x f(g(x)) = J_g(x) \\nabla_z f(z).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is automatically performed in Pytorch by calling the `.backward()` method on any non-leaf tensor. The gradient with respect to $x$ can then be accessed by calling `x.grad`. For example:"
